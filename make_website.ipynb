Anyone who wishes to produce copies for purposes other than those specified above must obtain the permission of the authors.  An Open Letter to Psychology Majors Dear Psychology Majors,  I taught, advised, and mentored psychology majors for 40 years at both a small, private, residential, liberal arts college and a large, public, commuter, research university.  Although these two schools were remarkably different, all my students were concerned about their ability to provide a confident answer to the following perennial question, “What can I do with a bachelor’s degree in psychology?”  (For an explanation of why this question is so challenging, access my article titled How to Maximize the Blessings and Minimize the Curses of Being a Psychology Major listed in the reference section.)  The remarkable pervasiveness of this query among my students motivated me to create and teach a careers-in-psychology class to help them answer it and to write a textbook for the class titled The Savvy Psychology Major (Appleby, 2008).  The goal of the class was to enable students to become savvy psychology majors by creating an educational plan that would enable them to give clear, complete, convincing, and confident answers to the following questions:    What careers can I enter if I major in psychology? Which of these careers would be a good choice for me on the basis of my skills, values, and interests? Which of these careers can I enter with a bachelor’s degree, and which will require a graduate degree? What knowledge, skills, and characteristic (KSCs) must I possess to enter and succeed in my chosen career? How can I use the curricular and the extracurricular components of my education to develop these KSCs? How can I convince potential employers or graduate school admissions committees that I possess these KSCs so they will hire me with a bachelor’s degree or accept me into their graduate program?  This resource, combined with some serious and honest self-reflection, can help you answer the first four of these questions.  Once you feel comfortable with your answers, your next step should be to meet with your academic advisor.  Explain your answers to these four questions during this meeting, and then ask your advisor to work with you as you create a plan for the remainder of your undergraduate education that will help you choose the classes and engage in the extracurricular activities (e.g., research, internships, service learning, and leadership opportunities) that will enable you to develop the KSCs you need to prepare yourself for your chosen career.  The final step will depend upon if your career requires you to earn a degree beyond the bachelor’s.  If it does, seek the aid of a faculty mentor who can help you create and obtain the documents you will need to apply successfully to a graduate program (i.e., a curriculum vitae, a personal statement, and at least three strong letters of recommendation from appropriate people).  If you can enter your chosen career with a bachelor’s degree, then visit your career center where a professional employment counselor can help you create the necessary documents and information you will need to be hired (i.e., a resume, a cover letter, and effective answers to challenging interview questions).  This strategy is a complex task, so it is best to break it down into three smaller and more manageable steps by understanding, embracing, and living out the wisdom of the following short, but venerable quotations.   The Oracle at Delphi (speaking through Socrates), said “Know thyself.”  Savvy psychology majors know themselves when they can honestly and accurately identify their most important skills, interests, and values.  Shakespeare wrote Hamlet in which Polonius provided the following sage advice to his son Laertes, “To thine own self be true.”  Savvy psychology majors are true to themselves when they (a) use their self-knowledge to identify careers in which they can perform well, enjoy the work they do, and value the products of their work and then (b) create realistic plans to use their undergraduate educations to prepare for, enter, and succeed in these careers.  Nike (the Greek goddess of victory), speaking through her 21st century commercial namesake, said “Just do it.”  Savvy job-seeking psychology majors just do it when they put their realistic plans into action by actually engaging in the specific behaviors that will enable them to successfully enter and succeed in their chosen careers.  I used these three pieces of advice to help thousands of students answer the question, “What can I do with a bachelor’s degree in psychology?”  Although I am now retired and you are not my students, it would give me great satisfaction if you were willing to use the information in this resource to become savvy psychology majors.   Sincerely yours,   Drew C. Appleby, PhD Professor Emeritus of Psychology Director of Undergraduate Studies in the IUPUI Psychology Department (Retired) Associate Dean of the IUPUI Honors College (Retired)  PS: I have been working on this resource for over 30 years ago, and it is still not a finished product; it is a work in progress.  If you (a) discover any errors such as dead hotlinks or online sources that contain inaccurate or inappropriate information; (b) are aware of any trustworthy online resources that would expand this list; or (c) would like to recommend a career that can be added to this resource, please share this information with the me at dappleby@iupui.edu.  Rationale and Purpose of This Resource  Undergraduate psychology programs have traditionally provided students with an abundant variety of opportunities to acquire the KSCs necessary to prepare for graduate school, which is the post-baccalaureate step most familiar to psychology faculty.  While this strategy has worked well for the small subset of psychology majors who enter graduate school after completing their undergraduate education, it has not always been as successful for the vast majority who enter the workforce immediately after they graduate.  The authors of the APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major (American Psychological Association [APA], 2013) recognized this problem and sought to reduce its negative impact by urging undergraduate programs to help their career-seeking students develop more meaningful professional direction by (a) acquiring an understanding of the careers in which people with backgrounds in psychology are typically employed and (b) becoming familiar with the KSCs desired by those who hire people with baccalaureate degrees in psychology.  Once students acquire this foundational information—and use it to identify their potential career paths—faculty and advisors can provide them with specific strategies to utilize their curricular and extracurricular opportunities to identify, clarify, prepare for, and attain their professional goals.  The purpose of this resource is to provide ALL psychology majors—whether or not they plan to attend graduate school—with access to the broad panorama of careers they can enter, the nature of these careers, and the KSCs they will need to obtain and succeed in these careers.   Description and Instructions for the Resource  The 300 careers in this resource are accompanied by more than 2,300 internet sites that contain information about the nature of these careers.  To increase the navigational efficiency of this 83-page resource, these careers are organized into the following 15 broad occupational clusters, which are highlighted in YELLOW.  This structure enables users to identify groups of related careers that fit their unique patterns of interests, values, goals, skills, and knowledge and then locate these groups with the hyperlinks below.   Business, Advertising, and Finance Children and Families Counseling Education Health and Medical Services Human Resources Law and Law Enforcement Military Psychology Religion and Spirituality Social and Human Services Sport, Fitness, and Recreation Technology Therapy Other  Persons employed in 56 of these careers bear the official title of psychologist and must earn a graduate degree.  Persons employed in the remaining 244 psychology-related careers (i.e., careers that require the demonstration of psychological knowledge and/or skills, but which do not carry the title of psychologist) are divided almost equally into two categories: those whose careers can be entered with a bachelor’s degree (highlighted in BLUE), and those whose careers require a graduate degree (highlighted in GREEN).  Careers are listed alphabetically in each of these categories.  In addition, I have marked with  those careers rated by O*NET as having a bright outlook because they are expected to grow rapidly in the next several years, will have large numbers of job openings, or are new and emerging occupations.  Many careers appear in more than one category, such as Educational Psychologist, which can be found in both the Education and the Psychology categories.  Each career is followed by a set of hotlinks to a variety of online sources that provide users with answers to the following questions.  What KSCs are required in this career? What tasks do workers perform in this career and under what conditions do they carry out these tasks? What types of job training or education are required to enter this career? What interests and values do workers in this career possess? How much money do people employed in this career earn? How many people are employed in this career, and what is the projected need for it in the future? What other occupations are related to this career?  A label that identifies its source precedes each hotlink. These labels and their sources are below. DOT, OOH, and O*NET: government websites that enable visitors to explore careers  Wild Card: a nongovernmental website that enables visitors to explore careers Video: a YouTube or other online visual media source created to enable site visitors to explore careers, some of which feature “a day in the life” of a person employed in a particular career Interview: an interview with a person employed in a particular career  STP and a Chapter Number: a chapter containing advice about how to prepare for a career in a sub-discipline of psychology that appears in an edited e-book titled Academic Advising: A Handbook for Advisors and Students: Volume 2: A Guide to the Sub-Disciplines (Irons & Miller, 2015) published by Division 2 of APA (The Society for the Teaching of Psychology) APA Careers: a resource created by APA to enable site visitors to explore careers in a specific sub-discipline of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, or industrial/organizational psychology) APA Psychologist Profile: a profile of a psychologist from APA’s multimedia campaign (www.PsychScienceAction.org) who is using her/his psychological expertise to improve human welfare by performing research on problems such as Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, and distracted driving APA Applied Research: a summary of how the results of research of APA members in a particular psychological sub-discipline have been applied to promote human welfare \n",

A Six-Step Strategy to Use This Resource Successfully  My fondest desire is for you to use my resource to identify, investigate, prepare for, obtain, and succeed in the kind of occupation that will cause you to wake up each the morning with a strong desire to go to work and to come home each night with a genuine sense of satisfaction gained from having accomplished professionally challenging and personally worthwhile tasks.  The best way to do this is to make a firm commitment to engage in the following six-step professional development strategy. Choose a broad occupational field (e.g., business, health care, education, or social service) in which the work you will do would be a good match for your strengths, interests, values, and goals. Examine several careers in this field and choose one whose description makes you excited about obtaining it.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Job: Investigate\n",
      "Content: Investigate this career carefully to determine the KSCs you will need to succeed in it.  (You should also visit https://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/psn/2019/02/skillful-student where you will become aware of the transferable skills you will need to succeed in the 21st Century workforce regardless of what occupation you enter.) Work with your academic advisor to develop a plan to use both the curricular and extracurricular components of your undergraduate education to acquire these KSCs. Collaborate with your faculty mentor or a professional career advisor to create strategies that will convince employers to hire you (e.g., cover letters and resumes) or graduate school admissions committee to accept you (e.g., personal statements and a curriculum vitae). Finally, do everything in your power to carry out your academic plan and to put your strategies to work when it is time to make your transition from college to the next stage of your professional development. Begin this strategy now, not tomorrow, not at the end of the semester, and absolutely not until after you graduate. Just remember that more than 100,000 other psychology majors will graduate with you. They all want good jobs too, but until they discover and use this resource, you will be the only one who has the online information it provides and a six-step strategy to use this information to obtain the career you want.   A Very Important Caveat About the Jobs Contained in This Resource  Please read the following quotation from Landrum (2018) very carefully.  It explains why the possession of a bachelor’s degree in psychology neither guarantees nor entitles its owner to successfully obtain the careers in this resource because of five specific types of competition for these jobs.      “To say that a bachelor’s degree in psychology prepares you for no job is simply ludicrous. But let’s think about the more nuanced part — a bachelor’s degree in psychology does not exclusively entitle a person to any of the jobs in this list.  Using O*NET from the U.S. Department of Labor (2017) for the following bulleted data, allow me to explain what I mean by psychology’s lack of exclusivity. For a job like animal trainer, the vast majority of individuals with this job have a high school diploma (or less) as their highest educational attainment. So a bachelor’s degree (in any field) is not necessarily a prerequisite requirement. In order to be a claims supervisor (claims examiner) for an insurance company, nearly 70 percent of those individuals have a bachelor’s degree. This type of position can be filled by individuals from many different majors. To serve as a corrections officer, 89 percent of individuals in this career have a high school diploma or equivalent. Psychology majors can do well in this area, but as you can probably understand, so do criminal justice majors, sociology majors, and others. Thirty percent of labor relations specialists hold bachelor’s degrees, and 25 percent hold master’s degrees.  A psychology major could certainly attain this job, but will sometimes be competing with others with higher educational attainment. Technical writers typically require some college (35 percent associate’s degree and 33 percent bachelor’s degree), but as you can imagine, a psychology major competing for this position would also be competing with individuals who were English majors in college. It is my hope that these examples illustrate the nuance and complexity of discussing career options for psychology workforce graduates. There are many, many job possibilities, but there is also much competition awaiting in the workplace due to the lack of exclusivity.  Psychology majors, no matter what the career trajectory, need to be thinking about, cultivating and honing their skill sets; in that regard, I highly encourage you to review the works of Miller and Carducci (2015) and Strohmetz et al. (2015).  Do not be passive about your future, hoping that it “all comes out in the wash” — be forcefully empowered to be your own best ally and advocate for a satisfying and successful future.”  Notes of Appreciation  I would like to thank the students in Dr. Virginia Wickline’s Fall 2018 PSYC 2231 class at Georgia Southern University’s Armstrong Campus for providing me with suggestions to increase the quality of this resource and Dr. Kit Nast of Bishop State Community College for sharing his excellent videos with me and keeping them up-to-date.
